Particle system initialization: The particle array is used to store the properties of particles. Each particle contains the position (x, y), size (size), and color (color).

Setup () function: The canvas size is initialized to 800x600 pixels, and the stroke (stroke ()) is turned off to ensure that the graphics have only fill color.

draw() function:Background update: Use a semi-transparent background (background(20, 20, 40, 50)) to achieve a frame-by-frame visual afterimage effect. Particle generation: In each frame, a new particle is added to the particle array. The new particle's properties are randomly generated by the random() function, including position, size, and color. Particle drawing and updating: A circle (ellipse()) is drawn for each particle and filled according to its color by traversing the particle array. The particle size decreases by 5% over time (p.size *= 0.95).

Particle filtering: When the size of a particle shrinks below 0.1, it is removed from the array via filter() to optimize performance. In every frame, some random particles are generated, slowly getting smaller on the canvas until they disappear. Watching the particles appear and disappear like elves, many new ideas come to my mind, such as whether the particles can change with the movement of the mouse or add more color gradients and interactive effects. There is also a gradient of the background color, which should also make the picture more layered.
